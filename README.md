# OptimizationComputation
(复习的时候顺便写的)integrated several optimization algorithms and still in the process of updating
Because I have an optimization theory exam on May 23rd, I decided to write the algorithms in code while reviewing them. 
It's actually quite fun. So far, I have only completed the code for one-dimensional linear search, including algorithms like the 0.618 method and Goldstein's algorithm.
I haven't started writing the code for the descent algorithms yet (such as Newton's method, steepest descent, coordinate descent, etc.), but I will do that later. 
Afterwards, I plan to write a computational package for constrained optimization algorithms.
因为5月23号要考最优化理论，我就顺带复习算法的时候把他们都写成代码了。也是蛮好玩的事情呢，不过目前只完成了一维线性搜索部分的代码，一些0.618法啦GoldStein算法之类的算法。下降算法部分(牛顿法，最速下降法，坐标轴下降等等)还没开始写，以后会补上的。之后我还会写有约束优化算法的计算包。
